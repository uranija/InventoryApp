# InventoryApp
## Tenth project in ABND course

The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It will also need to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned about data storage in Android, using both SQLite tables and file storage on the device. These skills let you build apps which are critical to small businesses worldwide. By practicing these skills and building this app, you will have the foundation to build similar apps for any kind of business.

## Project requirements
- Storing information in a SQLite database
- Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
- Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
- Updating information based on user input
- Creating intents to other apps using stored information.
