# InventoryApp
## Tenth project in ABND course

The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app had to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It also needed to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

## Project overview
- Data storage in Android, using both SQLite tables and file storage on the device. These skills let you build apps which are critical to small businesses worldwide. 
- Building this app puts the foundation to build similar apps for any kind of business.

## Project requirements
- Storing information in a SQLite database
- Integrating Android’s file storage systems into that database
- Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
- Updating information based on user input
- Creating intents to other apps using stored information.
